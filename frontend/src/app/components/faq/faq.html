    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h2>What is this project about?</h2>
    <p>
      This project is all about making certificate transparency data easier to access and explore.
      Every time a website issues or renews a certificate, that event is logged publicly.
      We connect to those logs, process the information, and make it available so that anyone can
      analyze trends, track suspicious activity, or simply learn more about how certificates are used across the internet.
    </p>

    <h2>How do you collect the information?</h2>
    <p>
      We don’t collect the data ourselves — instead, we subscribe to existing public endpoints that stream
      certificate activity in real time. Think of it as “listening in” on a public feed:
      whenever a new certificate is logged, our system receives it immediately and stores it for further use.
    </p>

    <h2>Is it possible to get an API key?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes! If you’d like programmatic access to the data, just send us an email at
      <a href="mailto:security@fivesec.de"><b>security@fivesec.de</b></a>.
      We’ll provide you with an API key and the necessary details to get started.
    </p>

    <h2>Can I get a full dump of the data?</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, no. The certificate data grows by several gigabytes every single day,
      which makes it difficult to provide a full database export.
      Hosting or transferring such a large and ever-expanding dataset just isn’t practical.
      That’s why we recommend using our API — it gives you flexible access to the data you need,
      without the overhead of handling the entire dataset yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>Can I get the code?</h2>
    <p>
      Absolutely! The entire project is open source and available on GitHub.
      You can browse the code, explore how everything works under the hood,
      or even contribute improvements if you’d like.
      Just click the <strong>Opensource</strong> button in the top right corner of the page,
      and it will take you directly to our GitHub repository.
