    <h1>About the Project</h1>

    <p>
      The internet relies on digital certificates to create trust — every time you visit a secure
      website, a certificate is issued to prove that the site is legitimate and the connection is encrypted.
      Behind the scenes, millions of these certificates are created, renewed, or revoked every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our project was built to make this certificate activity easier to explore, understand, and monitor.
      By subscribing to public certificate transparency streams, we collect and process the data in real time.
      This allows us to provide insights into what’s happening across the internet, from the registration of
      new domains to potential security issues.
    </p>

    <h2>Why we built it</h2>
    <p>
      Certificate data is public by design, but working with it directly can be complex.
      We wanted to simplify this by creating a platform that makes certificate activity more accessible
      to researchers, security professionals, and curious developers.
      Our goal is to promote transparency, improve security awareness, and make valuable data
      available in an open and useful way.
    </p>

    <h2>What you can do with it</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Explore new certificates as they appear in real time</li>
      <li>Track activity for specific domains or organizations</li>
      <li>Use the API to integrate certificate data into your own tools</li>
      <li>Experiment with the open source codebase and contribute improvements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Open source and community-driven</h2>
    <p>
      Transparency is at the heart of this project, which is why we’ve made the entire platform open source.
      You can find the code on GitHub (just click the <strong>“Opensource”</strong> button at the top right).
      We welcome feedback, contributions, and new ideas from the community — whether it’s improving
      performance, adding features, or simply fixing a typo.
